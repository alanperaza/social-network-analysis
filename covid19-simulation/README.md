# Covid-19 simulation using the SIR Epidemic Model.

In this project I created a simulation of a virus with the pathogenic characteristics of Covid 19. To do this, I conducted an investigation of what (so far) was known about the virus.

The dataset used emulates a working environment of 1429 people. To find out how the virus behaves in this environment, 3 tests were performed:

* How the number of infections evolved if no person took preventive measures.

* How the number of infections evolved if employees used masks.

* How the number of infections evolved if employees were sent home.

The result is 3 graphs with the metrics of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals over time for each of the prevention strategies.

The data and studies I worked with date back (at best) to 2021, so there may be some discrepancies with respect to more current data.
