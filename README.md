# Social Network Analysis

This repository contains some social network analysis projects that I have performed over time. The whole process of data preparation and visualization was done with Python. The original datasets were extracted from online sources. If you wish to obtain them as well, you can check the bottom of each Jupyter Notebook.

Feel free to copy/reuse the code provided here :).
